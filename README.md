User Story : As someone who loves cooking, I sometimes struggle to use the ingredients I have on hand, or struggle to come up with new and interesting ideas for food and drinks.  
We wanted an easy to use application to help us use specific ingredients in recipes, and to be able to lookup drink recipes by name or ingredient, so that we could better eliminate waste in our kitchens, and to give us new ideas for dinner.

Functionality: The site uses [The Cocktail DB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) and [Edamam Recipe Search](https://developer.edamam.com/) api(s) to provide search results. When a user first opens the website they are greeted with a message to explain what it does.

Then the user can click on either the drinks, or the dinner buttons, different options will display depending on their choice.

If a user were to select the dinner button they now have the option to add what ingredients they have/want, and what they do not want.
Once the search parameters are chosen the site will retrieve 6 random recipe cards within the search criteria. These cards contain the all ingredients necessary for the recipe, a user can click the image which will give them the full instructions.
The drink search works similarly, difference is that there is a random button for completely random drinks, and a user can search for a specific drink.
